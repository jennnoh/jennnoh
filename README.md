# Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!👋

My name is Jenny, and I am a third-year student at the University of Toronto 🇨🇦. I major in Statistics, and minor in Computer Science and Psychology. I am passionate about making the world a fairer, more just, and more accessible society with the latest technology. My main interest is machine learning, but as a student who keeps learning, this might change anytime-- or narrow down and become more specific!
